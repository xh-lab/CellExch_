Description: scRNA-seq analysis is complicated by the excess of zero or near zero counts in the data, which are the so-called dropouts due to low amounts of mRNA within each individual cell. scImpute is developed to simultaneously determine which expression values are affected by dropout events in scRNA-seq data and perform imputation only on dropout entries.
